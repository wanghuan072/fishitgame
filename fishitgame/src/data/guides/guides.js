</h2>
<h2><strong>Phase 1: The Best Beginner Spot Early Game</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>🌋 Location: Kohana Volcano (Magma Fishing)</strong></h3>
<p>Before you can reach the ultimate money spot, you need capital. The best place to grind your first fortune is Kohana Volcano.</p>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>How to get there:</strong> Take your boat to Kohana Island. Walk straight until you reach the massive volcano.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Where to fish:</strong> Go inside the volcano. You can fish from the top ledges or go down to the bottom near the lava. It doesn't matter where you stand, as long as you are casting into the lava.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Why this spot?</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>High Value Fish:</strong> The "Fish Index" here includes valuable catches like the <em>Magma Goby</em>, <em>Lava Butterfly</em>, and the <em>Blueflame Ray (Mythic)</em>.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Easy Mythicals:</strong> The Mythical fish in this area are relatively easier to catch compared to other zones.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>🎯 The Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Always aim for the 2x Luck on your cast bar (wait for the bar to fill up before clicking).</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Your Goal:</strong> Grind here until you save exactly 75,000 Coins. Do not spend your money on useless upgrades yet.</p>

<h2><strong>Phase 2: The Investment Required</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>🤿 Item: Diving Gear</strong></h3>

<p>Once you hit 75,000 coins from the Volcano, head to the small utility island/shop (often near the spawn or marked on your map).</p>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Purchase:</strong> Buy the Diving Gear.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Cost:</strong> 75,000 Coins.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> You cannot access the best money spot in the game without being able to breathe underwater.</p>

<h2><strong>Phase 3: The End-Game Spot Best for Money</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>🗿 Location: Sisyphus Statue (Underwater)</strong></h3>

<p>This is it. The absolute <strong>Fish It best spot for money</strong> in the current update. If you join any server, you will see almost the entire lobby fishing here.</p>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>How to get there:</strong> Equip your Diving Gear and jump into the ocean. Swim straight down into the deep sea area.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Navigation:</strong> You will see two main areas down there: a <em>Treasure Hall</em> and a <em>Statue area</em>. You want to go to the Statue Area (look for the "Sisyphus Statue" label).</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Why this is the Best Spot:</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>The Deep Sea Quest:</strong> There is a specific quest board here ("Catch 3 Mythic Fishes", etc.) that gives huge rewards.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Secret &amp; Mythic Fish:</strong> This area spawns 3 different Mythical fish and 1 Secret fish. These sell for the highest prices in the game.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Massive XP &amp; Gold:</strong> Catch logs show players pulling fish worth hundreds of thousands continuously.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Pro Tip: Just like in the volcano, position yourself comfortably. Since the area is crowded, you know it's the right place.</em></p>

<h2><strong>📝 Summary: The Money Route</strong></h2>
<p>To maximize your earnings, follow this simple roadmap:</p>

<ol>
    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Start at <strong>Kohana Volcano</strong>: Farm Magma fish until you have 75k Coins.</li>
    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Buy <strong>Diving Gear</strong>: Essential for progression.</li>
    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Move to <strong>Sisyphus Statue</strong>: This is the permanent best spot where you will farm for end-game rods and leaderboards.</li>
