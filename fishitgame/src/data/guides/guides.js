    <p>Are you broke in Roblox Fish It? Do you want to buy the best rods but lack the coins? You don't need to waste time exploring every single island. According to the current meta, there are only two spots you need to know about.</p>
<h2>
    <img src="/images/guide/guide01-01.webp" alt="fish it money spot" width="50%" style="width: 50%;">
</h2>
<h2><strong>Phase 1: The Best Beginner Spot Early Game</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>🌋 Location: Kohana Volcano (Magma Fishing)</strong></h3>
<p>Before you can reach the ultimate money spot, you need capital. The best place to grind your first fortune is Kohana Volcano.</p>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>How to get there:</strong> Take your boat to Kohana Island. Walk straight until you reach the massive volcano.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Where to fish:</strong> Go inside the volcano. You can fish from the top ledges or go down to the bottom near the lava. It doesn't matter where you stand, as long as you are casting into the lava.</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Why this spot?</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>High Value Fish:</strong> The "Fish Index" here includes valuable catches like the <em>Magma Goby</em>, <em>Lava Butterfly</em>, and the <em>Blueflame Ray (Mythic)</em>.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Easy Mythicals:</strong> The Mythical fish in this area are relatively easier to catch compared to other zones.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>🎯 The Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Always aim for the 2x Luck on your cast bar (wait for the bar to fill up before clicking).</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Your Goal:</strong> Grind here until you save exactly 75,000 Coins. Do not spend your money on useless upgrades yet.</p>

<h2><strong>Phase 2: The Investment Required</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>🤿 Item: Diving Gear</strong></h3>

<p>Once you hit 75,000 coins from the Volcano, head to the small utility island/shop (often near the spawn or marked on your map).</p>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Purchase:</strong> Buy the Diving Gear.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Cost:</strong> 75,000 Coins.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> You cannot access the best money spot in the game without being able to breathe underwater.</p>

<h2><strong>Phase 3: The End-Game Spot Best for Money</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>🗿 Location: Sisyphus Statue (Underwater)</strong></h3>

<p>This is it. The absolute <strong>Fish It best spot for money</strong> in the current update. If you join any server, you will see almost the entire lobby fishing here.</p>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>How to get there:</strong> Equip your Diving Gear and jump into the ocean. Swim straight down into the deep sea area.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Navigation:</strong> You will see two main areas down there: a <em>Treasure Hall</em> and a <em>Statue area</em>. You want to go to the Statue Area (look for the "Sisyphus Statue" label).</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Why this is the Best Spot:</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>The Deep Sea Quest:</strong> There is a specific quest board here ("Catch 3 Mythic Fishes", etc.) that gives huge rewards.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Secret &amp; Mythic Fish:</strong> This area spawns 3 different Mythical fish and 1 Secret fish. These sell for the highest prices in the game.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Massive XP &amp; Gold:</strong> Catch logs show players pulling fish worth hundreds of thousands continuously.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Pro Tip: Just like in the volcano, position yourself comfortably. Since the area is crowded, you know it's the right place.</em></p>

<h2><strong>📝 Summary: The Money Route</strong></h2>
<p>To maximize your earnings, follow this simple roadmap:</p>

<ol>
    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Start at <strong>Kohana Volcano</strong>: Farm Magma fish until you have 75k Coins.</li>
    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Buy <strong>Diving Gear</strong>: Essential for progression.</li>
    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Move to <strong>Sisyphus Statue</strong>: This is the permanent best spot where you will farm for end-game rods and leaderboards.</li>
</ol>

    <p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Welcome to <strong>Roblox Fish It</strong>! This isn't just a fishing game; it is a game about <em>smart investment</em> and <em>luck management</em>. Many beginners waste hours grinding on the starter island without knowing the efficient path.</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">This guide will walk you through exactly how to speedrun the early game and earn your first <strong>1 Million Coins</strong>!</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">
    <img src="/images/guide/guide02-01.webp" alt="fish it 1" width="50%">
</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🟢 Phase 1: The Beginning (0 - 5,000 Coins)</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">📍 Location: Spawn Island / Shallow Waters</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">When you first enter the game with your basic rod, don't try to travel far. Build your foundation right here.</p>

<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>🎁 Redeem Codes First:</strong></li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>This is the most crucial step. Don't start empty-handed.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>
        👉 <a href="/codes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Click here to check the latest working Fish It Codes]</a> to get instant starting cash.
    </li>

    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>🎣 Master the "Perfect Cast":</strong></li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Don't just click and release! <strong>Click and Hold</strong> the left mouse button until the power bar is full. A full bar grants you a 2x Luck Bonus, which is vital for beginners to catch rare fish.</li>

    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>🚤 Buy Your First Boat:</strong></li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Once you have a few thousand coins, do not upgrade your rod yet. Instead, buy the cheapest <strong>Boat</strong> or <strong>Jetski</strong>. You need mobility to reach the real money-making spots.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🟠 Phase 2: The First Pot of Gold (5,000 - 75,000 Coins)</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">📍 Location: Kohana Volcano</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">This is the turning point for new players. Once you have a boat, drive straight to the massive volcano on the map—<strong>Kohana Island</strong>.</p>

<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Go Inside the Volcano:</strong> Don't fish in the ocean outside. Drive your boat <em>inside</em> the volcano into the lava pool.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Target Fish:</strong> The <strong>Magma Goby</strong> and <strong>Lava Butterfly</strong> here sell for much higher prices than common ocean fish. Yes, your starter rod can fish in lava!</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>⚠️ The Golden Rule:</strong> During this phase, resist the urge to spend money. Your goal is to save exactly 75,000 Coins. Once you hit 75k, stop fishing immediately and move to the next step.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🔵 Phase 3: The Giant Leap (Buying Diving Gear)</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🛠️ Key Item: Diving Gear</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">This is arguably the most important item in the entire game.</p>

<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Where to buy?</strong> Drive to the <strong>Utility Store Island</strong> or look for the floating Merchant with the blue icon on the sea.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Price:</strong> 75,000 Coins.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Why is it mandatory?</strong> Without Diving Gear, you will drown underwater. And in Fish It, all the most expensive fish are located in the <strong>Deep Sea</strong>!</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🟣 Phase 4: End Game Farming (The Holy Grail)</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">📍 Location: Sisyphus Statue / Deep Ocean</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Equip your diving tank, jump into the ocean, and swim straight down. You will find a massive underwater ruin.</p>

<ol>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Find the Statue Area:</strong> The deep sea has two zones: The Treasure Hall and the <strong>Sisyphus Statue</strong>. We recommend the Statue area.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Why is this the best spot?Mythical Fish Galore:</strong> This area has the highest spawn rate for Mythical tier fish.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Quest Rewards:</strong> The nearby quest board often has missions like "Catch 3 Mythic Fish" which pay huge rewards.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Server Buffs:</strong> You will find most pro players AFK fishing here. When many players gather, the server often gets active Luck Multipliers.</li>
    <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Strategy:</strong> Now you can finally start upgrading your <strong>Rod</strong> and rolling for <strong>Enchantments</strong>. Your goal is to get stats related to Mutation Chance.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>💡 3 Pro Tips to Avoid Mistakes</strong></h3>

<ol>
    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Value &gt; Rarity:</strong> Don't just obsess over "Mythical" rarity. A common fish with a <strong>"Galaxy" Mutation</strong> might be worth more than a plain Mythical fish. Use our <a href="/calculator/value" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Fish Value Calculator]</a> to check prices before you sell!</li>

    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Understand RNG:</strong> Sometimes you won't catch anything good for 30 minutes. That's normal. Use our <a href="/calculator/luck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[Luck Calculator]</a> to check if your loadout is optimized. Sometimes just changing your Bait makes a huge difference.</li>

    <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Weather Matters:</strong> If you see a <strong>Meteor Shower</strong> or <strong>Storm</strong>, do not log off! These are the best times to catch the top-tier Secret Fish.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🟢 Phase 1: The Noob Stage (Fisherman Island)</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>Goal:</strong> Understand mechanics &amp; get your first upgrades.</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Your Fish It Noob to Pro journey starts at the spawn. Do not leave this island until you have upgraded your rod at least once.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>1. Master the "Perfect Cast"</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Video Insight:</strong> Don't just click spam! Click and <strong>hold</strong> your mouse until the bar hits the green zone, then release. A "Perfect" cast gives you a luck multiplier.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Mechanic:</strong> Once the fish bites, click fast to reel it in.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>2. Quest Efficiency</strong></h3>

</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>3. First Upgrades</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Sell your catch at the Merchant.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Priority:</strong> Buy the <strong>Luck Rod</strong> (325 Coins) as soon as possible. Do not waste money on the "Styrofoam Bobber" yet. Your goal is the <strong>Carbon Rod</strong> (750 Coins).</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🟡 Phase 2: The Explorer Stage (Volcano &amp; Jungle)</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>Goal:</strong> Get a boat and find Rare fish.</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">To transition from Noob to Intermediate, you need mobility.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>1. Buy a Boat</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Purchase the <strong>Small Boat</strong> (300 Coins) or the <strong>Jetski</strong> if you have the cash.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Warning:</strong> The Small Boat is painfully slow (as seen in the video), but it’s necessary to leave the starter island.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>2. Destination 1: Kohana Volcano</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Drive your boat to the volcano island.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>The Lava Fisher:</strong> Climb the volcano. You can actually fish <em>inside</em> the lava!</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Target Fish:</strong> Magma Goby (1 in 55 chance). These sell for much more than the starter fish.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>3. Destination 2: Ancient Jungle</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>There is a temple here with a locked door saying "Find the Levers." While the puzzle is for later, the water around the jungle contains <strong>Water Snakes</strong> and <strong>Drippy Tucanare</strong>, which provide excellent XP.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">🔴 Phase 3: The Pro Stage (The Depths &amp; Enchanting)</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>Goal:</strong> Enter the "Lost Isle" and Enchant your Gear.</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">This is the most important part of the Fish It Noob to Pro guide. The real game begins underwater.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>1. The Essential Item: Diving Gear</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>You cannot become a Pro without this.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Cost:</strong> 75,000 Coins (or Robux).</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Video Strategy:</strong> The YouTuber bought this immediately. If you are F2P, you must grind the Volcano until you can afford this. It allows you to breathe underwater indefinitely.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>2. Location: Lost Isle / Esoteric Depths</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Go to the "Lost Isle" on your map.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Equip your Diving Gear and jump into the massive hole in the water.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Swim down until you reach the <strong>Treasure Hall</strong> (looks like Atlantis).</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>3. The Treasure Hall Farming</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>This area (Esoteric Depths) has the highest value fish.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Target Catch:</strong> Jellyfish (1 in 300) and Swordfish.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Video Highlight:</strong> The player caught a <strong>Swordfish (35.9kg)</strong> and a Jellyfish back-to-back here. This is the best money spot.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>4. Enchanting Your Rod</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Find the "Altar" in the depths.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>You need <strong>Enchant Stones</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Result:</strong> The video showed getting the <strong>"Leprechaun II"</strong> enchant, which gives +50% Luck. This is a massive boost for catching Mythicals.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">💎 The "Whale" Route (Pay-to-Win Strategy)</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">As seen in the video, spending Robux speeds up the Fish It Noob to Pro process significantly.</p>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">If you have Robux, skip the grind by buying:</p>

<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>The Chrome Rod:</strong> High luck and speed stats immediately.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Mini Hoverboat:</strong> Much faster than the Jetski, allowing you to chase "Shark Hunt" events.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Server Luck Boosts:</strong> Using the "Luck Machine" in the hub to get 4x or 8x Luck.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">
  <strong style="color: rgb(77, 184, 255);">🏆 Summary: Your Checklist</strong>
</h2>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">To complete your Fish It Noob to Pro transformation, you must:</p>

    <p style="margin: 1em 0px;">In Roblox <em>Fish It</em>, most players obsessively chase the <strong>Lucky</strong> or <strong>Mutation</strong> enchantments. However, based on recent tests by top-tier players, it turns out that <strong>"Level"</strong> is the most underrated source of luck.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">This guide will reveal how to use the <strong>"Experience" Enchantment</strong> to gain what is known as "Infinite Luck"—a permanent attribute boost.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>1. What is "Infinite Luck"?</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">In the game, your total Luck is composed of several parts (Rod, Potions, Server Buffs, etc.). There is one specific attribute called <strong>"Level Luck"</strong>.</p>

  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Feature:</strong> Unlike potions which have time limits, or server buffs that disappear when you leave, <strong>this luck is PERMANENT</strong> and uncapped (as long as you can level up).</li>

  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Level 959</strong> = Grants <strong>+143%</strong> Bonus Luck.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Level 1000</strong> = Grants <strong>+150%</strong> Bonus Luck.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> By gaining just 41 levels, the player gained 7% permanent luck. When you reach Level 1500 or higher, this number becomes massive.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>2. Core Strategy: The Experience Enchant Build</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Many beginners' first instinct is to enchant their rod with "Lucky" or "Mutation". <strong>Big Mistake!</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">If you want to easily catch Secret Fish (like <em>Elshark Gran Maja</em> or <em>Queen Crab</em>) in the late game, you should focus entirely on <strong>Experience</strong> in the early and mid-game.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>✅ Recommended Build:</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Priority Enchant:</strong> <strong>Experience I (or higher)</strong></li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Strategy:</strong> You MUST roll Experience on the first enchantment slot of your main rod.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Why?</strong> Although it doesn't add Luck directly, it doubles your leveling speed.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><em>Faster Leveling = Higher Level Luck = Easier Rare Fish later.</em></li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>⚔️ Comparison Case:</strong></h3>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>❌ <strong>Normal Player:</strong> Caught 800k fish without Experience enchant. Reached <strong>Level 1100</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span>✅ <strong>Smart Player:</strong> Caught the same amount of fish but used Experience enchant. Reached <strong>Level 1500+</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Result:</strong> The smart player gained dozens, if not hundreds, of extra permanent luck percentage points for free.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>3. When Should I Switch Off the Experience Enchant?</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">The video suggests this is a <strong>long-term investment</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Target Goal:</strong> Stick with the Experience Enchant until you reach <strong>Level 1200 ~ 1500</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>End Game:</strong> Once your level is high enough and your base luck is insane, you can switch the enchant to <strong>Mutation</strong> or <strong>Perfection</strong>. This is when your profit is maximized.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>4. Beginner Tutorial: How to Enchant?</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">If you don't know how to enchant your rod yet, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Get Enchant Stones:</strong> You can catch these purple stones by fishing in the Ocean, Tropical Grove, or <strong>Esoteric Depths</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Go to the Altar:</strong> Travel to the <strong>Esoteric Depths</strong> (the underwater area below Lost Isle). Find the glowing <strong>Altar</strong> in the middle of the map.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span><strong>Perform Enchantment:</strong> Hold the Enchant Stone, interact with the Altar, and select your rod. <strong>Goal:</strong> Roll the <strong>Experience</strong> stat!</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>💡 Summary (TL;DR)</strong></h3>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Don't be blinded by short-term gains!</p>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Don't chase Luck enchants immediately.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Put the <strong>Experience</strong> enchant on your rod.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>AFK grind to level up like crazy.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><span contenteditable="false"></span>Enjoy the <strong>"Infinite Luck"</strong> bonus from high levels to catch Secret Fish easily.</li>

    <p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Welcome to the ultimate progression walkthrough for Roblox's <em>Fish It</em>. With so many options available at Joe's Rods and hidden across the map, it can be confusing to know which gear to buy and which to skip. Whether you are a beginner or a pro grinder, finding the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> is essential for catching those elusive Mythical and Secret fish.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">In this guide, we will break down the most efficient path to power, reveal secret locations for high-tier gear, and settle the debate on what truly is the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> in the current meta.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><img src="/images/guide/guide05-01.webp" alt="Fish It Element Rod" width="50%" style="width: 50%;"></p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Early Game: The Free Alternative</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">When you spawn on Fisherman’s Island, you start with the basic Starter Rod. Most players immediately grind for the <strong>Luck Rod</strong> or the <strong>Carbon Rod</strong> at the shop. However, if you want to save coins while working toward the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong>, there is a secret trick.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>The Lava Rod Strategy:</strong> instead of buying the Carbon Rod, head to <strong>Kohana Volcano</strong>. Go inside the volcano, parkour up the center, and talk to the "Lava Fisherman."</p>

<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Reward:</strong> Lava Rod (Free)</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Stats:</strong> 30% Luck, 2% Speed, 100kg Weight.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">This rod has stats comparable to the paid Carbon Rod but costs nothing. This smart move saves your coins for the expensive end-game gear later on.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Mid-Game Progression: What to Buy and Skip</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">As you progress, you shouldn't buy every single item. To get the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> faster, you need to skip the "filler" rods.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>Recommended Path:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered"><strong>Damascus Rod:</strong> A solid upgrade from the Lava Rod.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><strong>Lucky Rod:</strong> This provides a massive jump to 140% Luck. Do not skip this; it is crucial for mid-game farming.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><strong>Steampunk Rod:</strong> A decent bridge, but you can skip it if you are patient.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><strong>Astral Rod (1,000,000 Coins):</strong> This is the king of the spawn shop. Before you venture into the secret islands, the Astral Rod is technically the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> available at the start.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Once you have the Astral Rod, go AFK at the <em>Sisyphus Statue</em> in the deep sea to grind money. You will need millions of coins for the next tier.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Late Game: Secret Locations &amp; Millions of Coins</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered">Once you have millions of coins, it is time to leave Joe's Shop. The contenders for the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> are hidden in specific biomes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>1. The Ares Rod (3 Million Coins)</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered">This rod is located at <strong>Tropical Grove</strong>. Once you arrive, look for the waterfall. The shop is hidden <em>behind</em> the waterfall inside a small cave. While excellent, it is just a stepping stone to the true <strong>Fish It best rod</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.17em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>2. The Angler Rod (8 Million Coins)</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered">This is the most expensive purchasable rod in the game. To find it:</li>
  <li data-list="bullet" style="padding-left: 3em;">Go to <strong>Esoteric Depths</strong> (located under Lost Isle).</li>
  <li data-list="bullet" style="padding-left: 3em;">You <strong>must</strong> have Diving Gear (75k coins) or you will drown.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet" style="padding-left: 3em;">Swim down past the Treasure Room to the building with the dome roof.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered">Inside, you will find the <strong>Angler Rod</strong>. With a price tag of 8 Million Coins and a stunning visual design, many players consider this the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> that money can buy.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>End Game: Angler Rod vs. Ghostfinn Rod</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered">So, what is the absolute <strong>Fish It best rod</strong>? It comes down to two options: the Angler Rod (Purchasable) and the Ghostfinn Rod (Quest Reward).</li>
  <li data-list="ordered"><strong>The Ghostfinn Rod</strong> is theoretically free, but it is locked behind the "Deep Sea Quest" board at the Sisyphus Statue. The final requirement is to catch one "Secret" fish at the statue. The drop rate for this secret fish is estimated to be <strong>1 in 3.5 Million</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered">Because the Ghostfinn is so difficult to obtain, for 99% of players, the <strong>Angler Rod</strong> is practically the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> you will actually use. However, if you have insane RNG luck, the Ghostfinn is the ultimate status symbol.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><img src="/images/guide/guide05-02.webp" alt="Fish It GHOSTFINN ROD" width="50%" style="width: 50%;"></p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Summary</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered">To summarize your journey to acquiring the <strong>Fish It best rod</strong>:</li>
  <li data-list="ordered" style="padding-left: 3em;">Get the free <strong>Lava Rod</strong> at the Volcano.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered" style="padding-left: 3em;">Save up for the <strong>Lucky Rod</strong> and then the <strong>Astral Rod</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered" style="padding-left: 3em;">Buy the <strong>Ares Rod</strong> (3M) behind the Tropical Grove waterfall.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered" style="padding-left: 3em;">Grind 8 Million coins to buy the <strong>Angler Rod</strong> in the Esoteric Depths.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered" style="padding-left: 3em;">Pray to the RNG gods for the <strong>Ghostfinn Rod</strong>.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered">Don't forget to enchant your gear! Use an Enchant Stone at the altar in the Esoteric Depths to roll for "Prismatic" or "Leprechaun" stats to make your <strong>Fish It best rod</strong> even more powerful.</li>

    <p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Are you struggling to upgrade your rods in Roblox <em>Fish It</em>? Enchant Stones are the key to unlocking powerful buffs like "Leprechaun" (Luck) and "Mutation Hunter." But where should you farm them? Is it the deep sea or the fiery volcano?</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">In this guide, we tested three major spots to find the absolute <strong>Fish It best location enchant</strong> farming spot. The results will surprise you.</p>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><img src="/images/guide/guide06-01.webp" alt="Enchant Stone 1" width="50%" style="width: 50%;"></p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>The Experiment: 3 Locations, 30 Minutes Each</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">We conducted a controlled test to determine which area yields the most Enchant Stones. Here are the contenders for the title of <strong>Fish It best location enchant</strong> farming:</p>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Kohana Volcano:</strong> The fiery heart of the map.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Esoteric Depths:</strong> The mysterious underwater realm.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Tropical Grove:</strong> A peaceful island with fewer fish types.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Test 1: Kohana Volcano (The Winner 🏆)</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Many players overlook the volcano, but our tests prove it is currently the <strong>Fish It best location enchant</strong> source.</p>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Time:</strong> 30 Minutes AFK Fishing.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Result:</strong> 8 Enchant Stones.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Why it works:</strong> The loot pool here seems perfectly balanced to drop stones frequently. If you want consistent upgrades, park your character here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Test 2: Esoteric Depths (The Loser ❌)</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">You might think the place where you actually <em>use</em> the stones would be the best place to <em>find</em> them. You would be wrong.</p>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Time:</strong> 30 Minutes AFK Fishing.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Result:</strong> 0 Enchant Stones.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Verdict:</strong> despite being a high-level area, the drop rate for stones here was abysmal during our test. Do not waste your time farming here.</li>
</ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Test 3: Tropical Grove (The Runner-Up 🥈)</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">The Tropical Grove has the smallest pool of fish (only 9 types), which theoretically increases the odds of rolling an Enchant Stone. However, reality didn't match the theory.</p>
<ol>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Time:</strong> 30 Minutes AFK Fishing.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Result:</strong> 1 Enchant Stone.</li>
  <li data-list="bullet"><strong>Verdict:</strong> While better than the Depths, it simply cannot compete with the Volcano.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;"><strong>Summary:</strong> If you are looking for the <strong>Fish It best location enchant</strong> farming spot, stop searching and go to <strong>Kohana Volcano</strong>. It provided 800% more stones than any other location in our test.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;"><strong>How to Use Your Enchant Stones</strong></h2>
<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Once you have farmed your stones at the Volcano, here is how to use them:</p>
<ol>
  <li data-list="ordered">Travel to <strong>Esoteric Depths</strong> (located under Lost Isle).</li>
  <li data-list="ordered">Pay the 400 coin fee to take the elevator down.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered">Find the glowing purple altar in the center.</li>
  <li data-list="ordered">Hold your Enchant Stone and interact with the altar to upgrade your rod.</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin: 1em 0px;">Stop wasting time in the wrong oceans. Head to the Volcano now and start stacking those stones!</p>
